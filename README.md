jmetadata
=========

Complete metadata automatically with MusicBrainz, LastFM or manually.

JMetadata is a  stand-alone application that keeps a good Metadata quality.
Metadata is the information about your music files such as genre, cover art, artist, title, track number, cd number, etc.
`Username & Password` are from your last.fm account, they are secure with JMetadata, because we only send a request to lastfm API. We will not store or send your last.fm account to another site. If you don't want to write your username and password you're able to use JMetadata with out signin anyway.
It requires Java JDK 21.
